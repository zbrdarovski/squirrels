## Project Structure:
StopTheSquirrels (structured programming):
- StopTheSquirrels.java (main class) contains the game implementation.
- DesktopLauncher.java (game window class) containts primary game window settings.

StopTheSquirrelsV2 (object oriented programming):
- StopTheSquirrelsV2.java (main class) game entry point.
- DesktopLauncherV2.java (game window class) contains primary game window settings.
- Assets.java - class that enables using, rendering and removal of game elements.
- Background.java - class used for background rendering.
- Basket.java - class for basket rendering and control.
- DynamicGameObject.java - abstract class, inherited by the basket, squirrel and hazelnut class.
- End.java - class to indicate end of game.
- GameObject.java - abstract class, from which every class (except main and launcher) inherits.
- Hazelnut.java - class for hazelnut initialization and rendering.
- Score.java - class for result update and rendering.
